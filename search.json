    "text": "1.2 Multiplicity Adjustment\nThe multiplicity strategy follows the graphical approach for group sequential designs of Maurer and Bretz (2013) which provides strong control of type 1 error. The procedure takes into account both sources of multiplicity: multiple hypothesis tests (e.g., across primary and secondary endpoints) and multiple analyses planned for the study (i.e., interim and final analyses).\nThere are two key components that define this approach\n\nTesting algorithm for multiple hypotheses specified by the graphical representation\nRepeated testing of some hypotheses using the alpha-spending function methodology\n\nThe multiplicity strategy will be applied to the 2 primary superiority hypotheses ( DrugX PFS BM+ and DrugX PFS all ) and 2 key secondary superiority hypotheses ( DrugX ORR all and DrugX PRO all ). Table @ref(tab:inputTable) summarizes the hypotheses specifying alpha-spending functions (for hypotheses to be tested group sequentially) together with the effect sizes and planned maximum statistical information (sample size or number of events).\n\n\n\nSummary of Primary and Key Secondary Hypotheses\n\n\nLabel\nDescription\nType\nInitial weight\nGroup Sequential Testing\nEffect size*\nn†\n\n\n\n\nH1\nDrugX PFS BM+\nprimary\n1\nKim-DeMets (power), parameter = 2\nHR = 0.60 (mCntl = 10.0 mo)\n263\n\n\nH2\nDrugX PFS all\nprimary\n0\nLan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming approximation\nHR = 0.70 (mCntl = 15.0 mo)\n350\n\n\nH3\nDrugX ORR all\nsecondary\n0\nNo group sequential testing\n0.15 (85% vs 70%)\n500\n\n\nH4\nDrugX PRO all\nsecondary\n0\nNo group sequential testing\n0.35\n500\n\n\n\n* Mean difference for binary and continouos endpoints or hazard ratio (HR) for TTE endpoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† Sample size or number of events for TTE endpoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure @ref(fig:timelinePlot) provides details as for statistical information projected to be available (in percentage relative to maximum) versus time since the trial start by the endpoint types. The vertical lines on the figure mark times on the interim analyses.\nThe overall type I family-wise error rate for 4 hypotheses, over all (interim and final) analyses, is controlled to 2.5% (one-sided).\nFigure @ref(fig:MTgraph) shows the graph where the hypotheses of interest are represented by the elliptical nodes. Each node has the hypothesis weight assigned to it (denoted by \\(w\\)). A particular value of \\(w\\) sets the local significance level associated with that hypothesis (which is equal to 0.025\\(w\\)). The graphical approach allows local significance levels to be recycled (along arrows on the graph) when a given hypothesis is successful (i.e., the corresponding null hypothesis is rejected) at interim or final analyses. Each arrow specifies the fraction of \\(w\\) (by the number attached to it) to be transferred from the source node to the destination node. This “alpha-propagation” results in a corresponding increase of the local significance level of the destination node. Figure @ref(fig:MTgraph) defines the initial configuration of the local significance levels and the directed edges (arrows). Particularly, the initial weight assignment for DrugX PFS BM+ is set to 1, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph Depicting Multiple Hypothesis Testing Strategy.\n\n\n\n\nThe testing algorithm codes a series of graph transformations which happens at each successful clearing of a hypothesis as described in Maurer and Bretz (2013). During an execution of the procedure, different scenarios as for local significance levels emerge in an iterative manner."
